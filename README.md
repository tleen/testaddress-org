# Test Address

This website is located at [testaddress.org](http://www.testaddress.org). It's purpose is to function as a default address for things needing a live site to test against. Sort of like [example.com/org/net](http://example.com) but I wanted it to be a little more useful in testing. So far the site only has two useful areas:

* **The Homepage** - [http://testaddress.org/](http://testaddress.org/), all .html pages will have embedded in their meta content a generation time under meta "generated".

* **JSON** - [http://testaddress.org/index.json](http://testaddress.org/index.json), A JSON object with the generated datetime.

If there are any additions you think will make the site more useful, [let us know](//github.com/tleen/testaddress-org/issues)!
